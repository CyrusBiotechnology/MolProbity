Original 4.2 install: This molprobity install was created in mid-May (?) 2015 as a hardware test then a beta server.  It became "real molprobity" served from molprobity.biochem.duke.edu on 7/24/15, at approximately 1437764774 POSIX time.  That timestamp (or maybe 3 hours earlier) is acceptable as the beginning cutoff for the real server logs.  It exists at ~rlab/Desktop/MolProbity.

4.2 refresh: this install was created September 16 by SML.  It exists at ~rlab/Desktop/MolProbity_4.2_Sept15_refresh/.  This refresh was created to pull in certain reduce bugfixes and match the cctbx version to exactly the PHENIX 1.10 release version.  It is expected to go online around 10:30 AM EDT September 17.
