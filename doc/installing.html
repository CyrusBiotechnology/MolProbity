  <title>Installing and Configuring MolProbity</title>
</head>
<body>
MolProbity often relies on symbolic links (symlinks), so it is critical
that your webserver be configured to follow symlinks fot the MolProbity
directories. For Apache, you should have a <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Options FollowSymLinks</span>
directive in the proper part of your <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">httpd.conf</span> file (usually in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/httpd/httpd.conf</span>).<br>
<br>
(Is this bit about symlinks still true?)<br>
<br>
In order for the web server to be able to access MolProbity data
correctly, it must have read, write, and execute permissions on the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">public_html/data/</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">tmp/</span> directories. If someone
other than the web server pseudo-user owns the files, this probably
implies a permission mask of 777. The same thing goes for <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">public_html/data/molprobity.log</span>.<br>
<br>
It's also important to be sure the programs in the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">bin/</span> directory have their
execute bit set for the web server pseudo-user.<br>
<br>
It's critical that the absolute path to the directory where MolProbity
is installed not have any spaces or other funky characters in it.
Alphanumerics, underscores, dashes, and dots are OK. Everything else is
off limits. Those weird characters interfere both with passing paths in
URLs (they have to be encoded and decoded) and with UNIX command line
programs (all paths have to be enclosed in extra quote marks).<br>

<h2>Required software on the server</h2>
<ul>
  <li>rm</li>
  <li>php (CLI version, 4.3.x and higher)</li>
  <li>many more, see <span style="font-family: monospace;">public_html/admin/check_config.php</span>!<br>
