Thank you for Downloading MolProbity! A lot of users want to get MolProbity metrics on a many PDBs. If this is the case for you, the MolProbity command-line tools are what want. Note that it is not necissary to setup a webserver if you are only interested in running the command-line tools. Here are some of the popular tools that may be of use to you.

All the tools are in the cmdline directory and are executable. Run from the unix command line. Instructions for running to follow.

Tool             Description
clashscore       This tool adds hydrogens and runs probe. It returns a list of
                 atoms with impossible steric clashes and the clashscore.

mp_geometry      This tool measures bond lengths and angle and returns a colon-
                 delimited string to stdout where each record corresponds to a
                 single residue. Each reccord reports either the length or angle
                 which diviates the furthest from ideal. Also reported is the
                 number of geometry outliers (either length or angle) in the
                 given residue.

oneline-analysis This tool returns several metrics on global structure quality
                 including MolProbity score and the clashscore. This will
                 return a colon-delimited string to stdout. Note that unlike
                 the other tools described here, oneline-analysis takes a
                 directory not a PDB file.

residue-analysis This tool returns metrics on the residue level including geometry
                 outliers, Ramachandran analysis, rotamer analysis, and clashes. 
                 This returns a comma-delimited string to stdout where each record
                 corresponds to a single residue.



Below are instructions on how to run each tool on the command line. 
'xxxx.pdb' is the PDB file to be analyzed.
'directory' is the directory wich contains the PDB files to be analyzed.

Tool              To run 
clashscore         % /path/to//MolProbity/cmdline/clashscore xxxx.pdb
mp_geometry        % /path/to//MolProbity/cmdline/mp_geometry xxxx.pdb
oneline-analysis   % /path/to//MolProbity/cmdline/oneline-analysis directory
residue-analysis   % /path/to//MolProbity/cmdline/residue-analysis xxxx.pdb
