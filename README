Installing MolProbity:

32 BIT linux may not be supported.

Welcome to MolProbity!!

Installation

Installation is fairlly straightforward. First move the MolProbity directory (the directory that this README file is in)  to a location where you want it to reside. Note that Apache will have to see MolProbity/public_html if you are interested in setting up a web service. Once the MolProbity directory is in the proper location, you are redy to install. Open a terminal and goto the MolProbity directory.

Note that it is not necissary to setup a webserver if you are only interested in running the command-line tools.

Linux users: ensure that gawk is on a path that the server can read (gawk may need to be installed).

1. Make sure that configure.sh is exectutable then run configure.sh. 

>>> ./configure.sh

This will install cctbx_project and needed components in MolProbity/sources:

    build list:
     annlib
     annlib_adaptbx
     boost
     cbflib
     ccp4io
     ccp4io_adaptbx
     cctbx_project
     chem_data
     lapack_fem
     probe
     reduce
     scons
     tntbx

and then will compile and configure in MolProbity/build.



2. Run setup.sh to configure the webserver.

>>> ./setup.sh

If setting up a webserver, make sure that the machine's Apache configuration can point to the MolProbity/public_html directory.
