<h3><a name="adding_hydrogens">Adding hydrogens</a></h3>
<b>Reduce</b> is a program developed by the Richardson Lab for adding hydrogen atoms to models of biological macromolecules.
<br><br>
Hydrogen atoms make up roughly half the atoms in a biological macromolecule, and interactions involving one or more hydrogen atoms dominate the interatomic contacts in models of these macromolecules.
Correct placement of hydrogen atoms is therefore essential to an accurate contact analysis of a macromeolecular model.
However, hydrogen atom positions are not usually resolved by x-ray crystallography experimental data, and so hydrogens are often left out of models.
Reduce provides a computational method to calculate expected hydrogen positions.
<br><br>
Reduce places hydrogens based on expected atomic geometry lengths and angles.
Where appropriate, it calculates atomic contact networks, and attempts to place hydrogens so as to facilitate hydrogen bonds and avoid steric clashes.
<!--NQH FLIPS - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<h3><a name="nqh_flips">NQH Flips</a></h3>
NQH "flips" are automatic repositioning of certain sidechains by Reduce to improve the all-atom contacts in a model.
<br>
<br>
The protein sidechains Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q), and Histidine (H) have asymmetric head groups, but are easily modeled in the wrong orientation in ambiguous density.
However, when Reduce calculates atomic contact networks, it can detect the correct orientations of NQH residues.
This detections is based on which orientation promotes hydrogen bonds and avoids steric clashes.

<br>
By default, adding hydrogens in MolProbity will perform flips for which there is convincing evidence.
In stand-alone Reduce, use the <i>-flip</i> flag to access this functionality.
Records of flipped residue choices and the scoring behind them are printed to the resulting PDB file as USER MOD records.

The current "flip" method is a three step process - an intuitive move, followed by two corrections.

<!--180 ROTATION - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<h3><a name="180_rotation">180&deg; rotation</a></h3>
First, the head group of the residue is rotated 180&deg;.
The stem atoms of the head group define the axis of this rotation (C&beta;-C&gamma; for ASN and HIS, C&gamma;-C&delta; for GLN). 
<!--HEAD GROUP HINGE - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<h3><a name="hinge_correction">Head group hinge</a></h3>
The atoms of the head group are not always modeled in plane with the stem.
If the head group atoms are not in plane with the stem, the rotation moves those atoms away from their original positions.
To correct for this move, the head group is hinged back into the same plane as its original position.

<!--THREE POINT DOCK - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<h3><a name="dock_correction"></a>Three point dock</h3>
The atoms of the head group are asymmetric.
Therefore, the 180&deg; rotation moves the head group atoms away from the original atom positions, affecting the atomic contacts.
A three-point dock corrects for this move.
<br>
<br>
<div class="indent"><img src="asn_superpose_compare.jpg" alt="Asn sidechain before and after flip" height="300" width="605"></div>

The sidechain is three-point docked as a rigid body.
The first point is the C&alpha; position, which is held constant.
