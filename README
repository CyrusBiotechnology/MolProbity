Installing the moltbx version of MolProbity:

Welcome to MolProbity!!

Installation

Installation is fairlly straightforward. First move the moltbx directory (the directory that this README file is in)  to a location where you want it to reside. Note that Apache will have to see moltbx/public_html. Once the moltbx directory is in the proper location, you are redy to install. Open a terminal and goto the moltbx directory.

1. Make sure that configure.sh is exectutable then run configure.sh. 

>>> ./configure.sh

This will install cctbx_project and needed components in moltbx/sources:

    build list:
     annlib
     annlib_adaptbx
     boost
     cbflib
     ccp4io
     ccp4io_adaptbx
     cctbx_project
     chem_data
     lapack_fem
     probe
     reduce
     scons
     tntbx

and then will compile and configure in moltbx/build.



2. Run setup.sh to configure the webserver.

>>> ./setup.sh

Make sure that the machine's Apache configuration can point to the moltbx/public_html directory.
