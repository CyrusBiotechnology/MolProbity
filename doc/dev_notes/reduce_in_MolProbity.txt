Notes on Reduce as used in MolProbity

This document attempts to record all of the (interesting) instances in which "reduce" appears in the MolProbity code base.

Most reduce invocations in the main MolProbity code are actually calls to one of a series of functions in lib/model.php
These functions contain commandline invocations of phenix.reduce using php's exec function
Centralizing the commandlines and routing through these functions to access them reduces code duplication and simplifies maintenance . . . if you know to look in lib/model.php, of course

Due to its importance, lib/model.php is covered first, then the other locations are covered in alphabetical order.

lib/model.php
----------
This is where most of the actual phenix.reduce invocations live
phenix.reduce invocations are accessed from other code via functions with explanatory names
I'll put the commandline calls for each of these function here, with parens around optional -nuclear flags:

reduceTrim()
  phenix.reduce -quiet -trim -allalt $inpath | awk '\$0 !~ /^USER  MOD/' > $outpath

reduceNoBuild()
  phenix.reduce -quiet -nobuild9999 (-nuclear) $inpath > $outpath

reduceBuild()
  phenix.reduce -quiet -nobuild9999 (-nuclear) $inpath > $outpath

reduceFix()
  phenix.reduce -quiet -build (-nuclear) -fix $flippath -allalt $inpath > $outpath

reduceEnsemble()
  calls either reduceBuild(), reduceNoBuild(), or reduceTrim()



bin/flipkin
----------
uses the -fix flag to force reduce to flip all possible sidechains, the results are used as input to flipkin kinemages.
contains direct phenix.reduce invocations
phenix.reduce -trim is piped to phenix.reduce -fix
Invocation exist in xray and -nuclear varieties

cmd/make_condor_file.py
----------
seems to set up for something else to run reduce, does not invoke reduce itself

cmdline/multichart
----------
calls runClashscore()


cmdline/multichart-cluster-coot
----------
calls runClashlist()*


cmdline/multichart-coot
----------
calls runClashlist()*


cmdline/multichart-directory
----------
calls runClashlist()*

cmdline/multikin
----------
checks $_SESSION['reduce_blength']
calls makeMulticritKin2()

cmdline/oneline-analysis
----------
checks $_SESSION['reduce_blength']
calls runClashscore()

cmdline/reduce-build
----------
calls reduceBuild(), which is in lib/model.php

cmdline/reduce-condor.py
----------
seems to set up for something else to run reduce, does not invoke reduce itself

cmdline/reduce-nobuild
----------
calls reduceNoBuild(), which is in lib/model.php

cmdline/reduce-trim
----------
calls reduceTrim(), which is in lib/model.php

cmdline/residue-analysis
----------
checks $_SESSION['reduce_blength']
calls runClashscore()

cmdline/view-pdb
----------
sets $_SESSION['reduce_blength']
calls reduceBuild(), which is in lib/model.php

config/defaults.php
----------
sets location of MP_REDUCE_HET_DICT for the molprobity environment
sets locations to the het dict in lib/ rather than the one in the reduce distribution

configure.sh
----------
does the svn checkout of reduce from github

jobs/ens_reduce.php
----------
calls reduceEnsemble()

jobs/fillfragments.php
----------
commented-out call to reduceNoBuild() after jiffiloop

jobs/reduce-build.php
----------
selects flags for reduce run
calls reduceBuild(), which is in lib/model.php for the actual reduce run

jobs/reduce-fix.php
----------
calls reduceFix()

jobs/reduce-nobuild.php
----------
calls reduceNoBuild()

lib/analyze.php
----------
checks $_SESSION['reduce_blength']
calls runClashscore()
analyze handles the comparison of flipped to unflipped models and runs reduce as part of this:
can call reduceNoBuild() on the original input file
can call reduceBuild() 


lib/core.php
----------
links to the reduce_setup page via the navbar
checks $_SESSION['reduce_blength']
prints message at bottom of page that announces which bond length is in use


lib/pdbstat.php
----------
sets! $_SESSION['reduce_blength']
  runs dangle to determine the fraction of Hs with non-electon H-bond lengths
  if that fraction is non-zero, 'reduce_blength' is set to nuclear

lib/reduce_het_dict.txt
----------
from config/defaults.php: define("MP_REDUCE_OLD_HET_DICT", MP_BASE_DIR."/lib/reduce_het_dict.txt")

lib/sessions.php
----------
sets $_SESSION['reduce_blength'] = "ecloud";
This is probably a default initialization that will be updated later is nuclear is selected

lib/visualize.php
----------
checks $_SESSION['reduce_blength']
invokes phenix.reduce -help to print reduce help text to the multicrit kinemage's @text field

pages/editpdb_setup2.php
----------
calls reduceTrim()

pages/ens_reduce_setup.php
----------
launchBackground(MP_BASE_DIR."/jobs/ens_reduce.php", "generic_done.php", 5);

pages/reduce_choose.php
----------
checks $_SESSION['reduce_blength']
launchBackground(MP_BASE_DIR."/jobs/reduce-fix.php", "reduce_done.php", 5);

pages/reduce_setup.php
----------
checks $_SESSION['reduce_blength']
launchBackground(MP_BASE_DIR."/jobs/reduce-build.php", "reduce_choose.php", 5);
launchBackground(MP_BASE_DIR."/jobs/reduce-nobuild.php", "generic_done.php", 5);

pages/sitemap.php
----------
menu link to reduce_setup.php

pages/welcome.php
----------
links to reduce_setup.php

public_html/download_trimmed.php
----------
calls reduceTrim()

test/simple_molprobity.sh
----------
several phenix.reduce invocations meant to reproduce the reduce usage during a typical MolProbity session
