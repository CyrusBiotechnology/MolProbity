===  TO DO  ==================================================================
==============================================================================
{{{ Ideas, long-term goals, etc.
    Write a decent document about installation of MolProbity for web and script use
    Could make it a web service with XML-RPC (SOAP, CORBA too complex)
    should session lifetime be from start, or from last use?
    document PHP version needed (which is...? >=4.1:superglobals >=4.3:CLI)
        4.1.0 doesn't work on kinemage: cmd line can't load 'session mm'
        4.1.2 seems to work on glass
    user should get partial results as big job is running ?
    Should analysis of worst residues ignore water or treat it separately?
    ZIP download should include a static view of the lab notebook?
    Retrieve maps from the EDS
    Add ribbons or something else colored by (absolute) occupancy
    Make color-coded versions of the flowchart for different stages of the process?
    Multicrit: views for trouble spots sorted by severity (also hypertext?)
    Create scripts for generating usage stats from molprobity.log
}}}
    Allow simple comparison of bad residues in two models; see jobs/analyze.php
    Rama outliers in multicrit kin don't look so hot (Ca-Ca, yellow?)
    Waters are dots instead of balls??
    No sc master on rotamers (how?)
    Develop multi-model version of the multicrit kin
    ORACLE output for TN Bhat
    Add documentation to the analysis results page (how to interpret)
    Add explanation of SSWING on setup page
    User sort multi chart by columns
  * User het dictionary: session var, prepend to std dict.
    Explicitly allow upload of kins
    Display comparison to run-of-PDB for clash score
    Specify what a CB outlier is
    Explain 2d and 3d CB kins

==============================================================================

### 3beta3 ###
- reworked lab notebook functions to allow automagicical entries and editing
- added automatic notebook entry for file upload
- made Analyze to Reduce -build link go to the setup page instead of improve_tab
- improved the job_progress Abort function
- added framework code to support lab book in analyze_display
  some odd hacks were required to get the right behavior -- I'd love
  to find a more elegant way of doing something like this.
- notebook edit page now protects HTML special chars properly upon save
- analysis page now generates reasonable notebook entries
- added NAR reference to home_tab.php
- added automatic labbook entry for Reduce -build
- added automatic entry for SSWING, with more ugly hacks.

### 3beta2 ###
- added timing notes to SSWING setup page
- links now highlight on hover using CSS A:hover
- changed feedback code to use \r\n instead of \n for new lines.
  This eliminates the error message, but mail still doesn't get delivered?
- now caching user feedback on disk in addition to trying to send mail.
  Not elegant, but ensures nothing is lost.
  Feedback page now doesn't report failure except in the system log.
- changed CSS to remove border from link images (needed in Mozilla)
- fixed potential div-by-0 bug in analyze_display (lines 51,59,etc)
- added display of B lt 40 clashscore
- made some timing improvements in job_progress: slows down for long jobs
- feedback page now asks user to not delete files
- fixed bugs on notebook_edit and added note about using HTML tags
- added "Close" button to kin viewing page
- added controls to set size of KiNG window
- changed "Get input models" to the more accurate "Get input files"
- added CSS for syntax highlighting of kinemage files; updated king.jar
- added syntax highlighted view of kinemage files
- fixed a file-download annoyance: now files and dirs sort separately
- added file viewing links to download page; combined viewhtml and viewtext
- fixed addmodel.php (upload system) to rename files with "weird" names
- patched filesystem-access security hole in viewtext.php
- patched filesystem-overwrite security hole in ED Map Upload system
- fixed addModel() to protect from case-insensitive file systems like OS X
- removed segID remapping from reduceNoBuild() b/c it's not appropriate
- segID remapping is now done immediately on upload
- user is now warned if segID remapping occurred
- this avoids the bug from Top500/1aacH.pdb, which had its H in segment 'new '

### 3beta1 ###
- first beta release for testing inside the Richardson lab
- rotamers weren't showing up in multi-crit kin due to a stray "s" before -scope
  Thus the error msg "Prekin can't open s-scope". Probably due to jEdit save bug

### 3pre17 ###
- decided all logging calls should be from public_html/* pages b/c we want to
  know about web traffic, not about scripted use by local users.
- inserted logging calls on many public_html pages
- got basic SSWING function working! Yay!!
- added "X minutes and Y seconds" formatting to job update page
- made "download all files" always avail. from files page
- added ED map support to viewking.php
- added custom views to the SSWING kinemage
- SSWING now creates a new model for the changes to go into
- added basic dots to SSWING kins
- added link to EDS (still need auto map download)
- modified sswing (Perl) to delete all files it creates; we use stdout only.
- changed sidechain colors for SSWING kins
- made sure proper SSWING binaries are in place for both OS X and Linux
- user can now accept or reject changes made by SSWING

### 3pre16 ###
- cleaned up lab notebook formatting a bit. Still needs better styling.
- wrote text for log out and save session pages
- wrote text for Reduce setup page
- formatted Asn/Gln/His checkbox table with MP_XXX colors
- wrote some text for after you've run Reduce
- started working on Feedback system
- completed code for Feedback system, seems to work but needs live testing
- added B-vals in pt ID and blackbody colored B-factor ribbons to multi kin
- added explanatory text to analysis setup page
- hacked together a crude multi-criterion chart
- added electron density map upload
- improved the analysis results page to make it more usable.
- added PDBSTAT text to the multicrit text window
- added makeZipForSession() to core.php
- file download page can now package things into ZIPs
- started building in mechanisms for running SSWING
- Subversion repository got screwed again!!
- upgraded to svn 1.1.0-rc1 and rebuilt repos with "fsfs" filesystem
  (fresh checkout is not needed if new repos is loaded from dump of old one)
- added SSWING binaries and scripts

### 3pre15 ###
- elaborated oneline-batch to handle running Reduce -nobuild too
  Still needs some work to really be clean.
- added listDir() to core.php
- used listDir() to clean up the weird problems with oneline-batch.php -reduce
- got new Prekin, Reduce
- learned the hard way to not do Subversion work inside sym link directories.
  I could recover by doing dump/load and a clean checkout, but scary...
- got new Reduce, Prekin binaries for the Mac
- makelinks.sh now also creates molprobity.log and sets its permissions
- still seems to work on OS X (whew...)
- changed limit for Reduce to 100,000
- added notification of disk space used
- fixed coloring issue for download table
- added robot-exclustion META to header
- cleaned up home_tab for public viewing
- added ALERT divs to home_tab and improve_reduce_choose
- commented out non-functioning placeholders in upload_tab
- dropped Reduce -limit to 10,000 b/c now 1SBP flipkins take a LONG time
- background jobs now record their PID and user can abort them (POSIX only)
  
### 3pre14 ###
- refactored multicriterion kin creation into makeMulticritKin()
- created outlier-res-batch.php to do analysis for JNB
- we now use dirname(__FILE__) instead of getcwd() to define MP3 install dir
  This means e.g. that cmdline/ scripts can be run from any directory
- removed useless Cb dev statistics
- modified pdbstat regex's again for R/Rfree to catch data from TNT
- changed resolution regex to pick up on resolutions like "2." and ".54"
- changed fixH.pdb suffix to Hfix.pdb because its easier to get right
- modified clashlist to avoid the divide-by-zero error for no atoms B &lt; 40
- made the default Linux bin dir "linux/", symlinked it to linux-rh73/
- added Perl to the list of external programs (for Mike's scripts)
- removed defunct Cb stats from oneline-batch.php
- reworked decodeReduceUsermods() to deal with rare cases that we were failing on
- added a countflips.php command-line script to checking on what Reduce did

### 3pre13 ###
- created a tmp/ directory just for use by MolProbity (file uploads, ZIPs, etc)
- allowed user to pull files from PDB
- reworked pdbstat() to be slightly more efficient (still takes ~15 sec on 1JJ2)
- upload page can deal with failed PDB/NDB upload in a basic way
- download from NDB works but is slow...
- connection to NDB FTP server takes ~30 seconds -- this is why so slow!
- added refinement program and temperature, R and Rfree to pdbstats page
- removed defunct images and mockup HTML pages
- added configuration page for Reduce -build
- incorporated Flipkin creation into the first Reduce step
- started porting the second, user-guided Reduce step
- finished the mechanics of porting the second Reduce step, now just UI tweaking
- updated the documentation on files created per model, and reorganized the sections
- added B-factor ribbons back to the multi-criteria kinemage
- made it so that second Reduce run is entirely skipped if no changes are requested
- marked models that have been through Reduce -build once; makes no sense to run them again!
- replaced progress bar image with a spinning ubiquitin ribbon drawing
- developed oneline-batch.php to extract basic quality stats from a folder of Reduced PDBs
- added calcCbetaStats() to find min, max, mode, mean, stddev
- improved REMARK regex's in pdbstat.php
- oops! I was calling the median "mode" in the above calcCbetaStats().
- code for tallying Rama outliers kept a running tally over all models (var not reset)
- Reduce 2.21 on Linux introduced line noise into some USER MODS, including ASCII 26 (hex 1a).
  Scrublines was set to terminate on this character, so I changed that and recompiled.
  This was previously causing affected PDBs to be truncated upon upload.
- improved regex's for R and Rfree to specify leading zero or decimal point
- changed loadClashlist() to guard against no clashes (and no summary!) for scores

### 3pre12 ###

- added reduceBuild() function to model.php
- implemented removeModel() and tested it from the command line scripts
- created a disk-too-full die() in mpInitEnvirons()
- added endsWith() to strings.php
- added system logging function. Individual user logging is of little use
  and will be effectively replaced by automated lab notebook entries.
- implemented a progress bar and list of tasks for analysis script
- did the same for addmodel and reduce-build jobs

### 3pre11 ###
- updated PDB stat to find nonpolar H in nucleic acids, too.
- updated pdbstat to find nucleic acid residues
- changed preparePDB() to not add H; now done by reduceNoBuild()
- renamed prepared() upload PDB so as not to confuse user
- reworked analysis scripts so that only selected jobs are performed
- reworked analysis so that hydrogens are added "just in time" if needed
- put both mc-mc and sc-(anything) dots in AAC kinemage, but separately
- removed Ramachandran JPEG and EPS files in anticipation of providing PDFs
- removed Mage as a necessary binary
- modified multicriterion kin to separate mc-mc and sc-x dots
- replaced findOutliers() with 4 separate functions
- analysis display page now adapts to the presence / absence of various criteria
- refactored jobs/addmodel.php into lib/model.php:addModel()
- refactored jobs/analyze.php into lib/analyze.php:runAnalysis()
- created a proof-of-concept cmd-line-driven script to use MP functions
- added machinery to create a ZIP archive of all a model's files

### 3pre10 ###
- really reworked page header/footer/styling. Style sheet hasn't been finished yet.
- removed all tab bar images and templates
- came up with a pretty decent "look" for the site; may change colors to match kinemage site
- rearranged upload page

- added CB dev, all-atom contacts to analysis output

### 3pre9 ###
- added 'ignoreSegID' option to handle old Reduce'd files with 'new' in segID field
- loadRamachandran() and loadRotamer() now decompose residue names into parts
- loadCbetaDev() now synthesizes a residue name from the parts

- badRes now markes residues with clashes >= 0.40 A
- refactored badRes code into lib/analysis.php:findOutliers()
- started lib/visualize.php to make data visualizations
- wrote functions to find res with alt confs and guess at res center in 3-space
- started working on the new MultiCrit

### 3pre8 ###
- brought the whole project under Subversion version control
- created a shell script to restore filesystem state (symlinks and permissions)
- created analyze_display.php for Jeremy to start working in
- fixed loadCbetaDev() to deal with multiple headers from Prekin
- created a basic file-listing page
- administrator can now "enter" sessions from the monitoring page
- mocked up some HTML layouts for pages
- check script now tells about how big file uploads can be
- added "last touched" to admin page
- moved all string and formating functions to strings.php
- set svn:ignore properties on public_html/ and on symlinks in bin/
- check for presence of models before trying to list them.
  Alternately, we could just define $_SESSION['models'] = array() at startup.
  Actually, lets do that too.

### 3pre7 ###
- filled in the PDB upload form, though it doesn't do anything yet.
- implemented first cases of "More/Fewer options" links
- implemented background execution via launchBackground()
- implemented background job monitoring via job_progress.php
- file upload now works, basically, though no processing is performed.
- added config parameter MP_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE
- worked out a bug in launchBackground(): session data wasn't written immediately
- addmodel.php now does some nice pre-processing of all new models uploaded
- pdbstat now reports refinement program and temp, and a count of CNS headers
- refactored jobs/addmodel.php to facilitate future offline scripts
- created a function to write session data to disk immediately
- reworked the definition of a model entry.
  Now using -build will create a new model, so you can compare to the old.
- did proof-of-concept for Cbeta deviation analysis and clashlist

### 3pre6 ###
- filled in the Finish tab (rough draft) to allow users to log out
- described what should go in each tab

### 3pre5 ###
- fixed bug in GC function
- made PATH in config.php depend on MP_BASE_DIR
- added some things to check_config.php
- PATH setup is smarter: auto-detects OS and adds our bin/ directory
- added read-only marker for sessions to enable D&J's partial results
- it might make sense to make labbook keywords an array, but then
  transmitting them in a form becomes harder.
- started working on a standard page header
- Experimented with tables, images to make tabs. Images are a better bet.
- made first drafts of all the tab pages (empty). Linked them together.

### 3pre4 ###
- refined sessions yet again: now each top level page must know where
  the base installation directory is, relative to itself.
- session support has been reworked to use MP_BASE_DIR
- session create now defaults to false. This limits points of entry.
- added marker file for session lifetime
- added administrator overview of current sessions
- created garbage collection functions

### 3pre3 ###
- added (optional) mode to mkdir() call in sessions.php
- added time zone support to lab notebook
- continued refining session code

### 3pre2 ###
- wrote the which() part of check_config.php
- configured sessions to never use cookies
