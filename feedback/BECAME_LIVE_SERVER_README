This molprobity install was created in mid-May (?) 2015 as a hardware test then a beta server.  It became "real molprobity" served from molprobity.biochem.duke.edu on 7/24/15, at approximately 1437764774 POSIX time.  That timestamp (or maybe 3 hours earlier) is acceptable as the beginning cutoff for the real server logs.
