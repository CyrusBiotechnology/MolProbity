MolProbity Multi-Criterion Chart Explained
Clashscore: The clashscore is the number serious steric overlaps (> 0.4) Angstroms per 1000 atoms. Recently, we have improved the hydrogen bondlengths and vdW radii in our all atom contact analysis.
Protein Geometry:
	Poor Rotamers: protein side-chains are rotameric, and poor rotamers are often indicative of non-standard side-chain orientation. While these are often due to model erors, some poor rotamers can be found at active sites and other chemically interesting parts of the structure, hence the goal of <1% rather than 0.
