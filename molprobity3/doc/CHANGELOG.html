===  TO DO  ==================================================================
==============================================================================
{{{ Ideas, long-term goals, etc.
    Write a decent document about installation of MolProbity for web and script use
    Could make it a web service with XML-RPC (SOAP, CORBA too complex)
    should session lifetime be from start, or from last use?
    document PHP version needed (which is...? >=4.1:superglobals >=4.3:CLI)
        4.1.0 doesn't work on kinemage: cmd line can't load 'session mm'
        4.1.2 seems to work on glass
    user should get partial results as big job is running ?
    Should analysis of worst residues ignore water or treat it separately?
    ZIP download should include a static view of the lab notebook?
    Retrieve maps from the EDS and allow map upload
    Do a better job of the B-factor colored ribbons kinemage
    Add ribbons or something else colored by (absolute) occupancy
}}}
    Allow simple comparison of bad residues in two models; see jobs/analyze.php
    Add text at top of multicrit kinemage
    Create multicrit chart
    Coloring on download table is sometimes off
    Put icons on analysis results page to identify the most-used kins
    Make automatic entries including protocols and references in notebook
  * Insert calls to logging functions (where?)
    Make color-coded versions of the flowchart for different stages of the process?
    Change makelinks.sh into a generic setup script that also sets permissions, creates molprobity.log, etc.

==============================================================================

### 3pre13 ###
- created a tmp/ directory just for use by MolProbity (file uploads, ZIPs, etc)
- allowed user to pull files from PDB
- reworked pdbstat() to be slightly more efficient (still takes ~15 sec on 1JJ2)
- upload page can deal with failed PDB/NDB upload in a basic way
- download from NDB works but is slow...
- connection to NDB FTP server takes ~30 seconds -- this is why so slow!
- added refinement program and temperature, R and Rfree to pdbstats page
- removed defunct images and mockup HTML pages
- added configuration page for Reduce -build
- incorporated Flipkin creation into the first Reduce step
- started porting the second, user-guided Reduce step
- finished the mechanics of porting the second Reduce step, now just UI tweaking
- updated the documentation on files created per model, and reorganized the sections
- added B-factor ribbons back to the multi-criteria kinemage
- made it so that second Reduce run is entirely skipped if no changes are requested
- marked models that have been through Reduce -build once; makes no sense to run them again!
- replaced progress bar image with a spinning ubiquitin ribbon drawing
- developed oneline-batch.php to extract basic quality stats from a folder of Reduced PDBs
- added calcCbetaStats() to find min, max, mode, mean, stddev
- improved REMARK regex's in pdbstat.php

### 3pre12 ###
- updated program requirements to list "zip"
- changed style sheet to sans-serif fonts, turned off link underlines
- changed color and upped contrast slightly on the logo
- added more elaborate flow chart
- created dummy pages for compare and improve
- created page to describe contents of uploaded file
- added Ramalyze PDF to analysis script
- swapped file upload and PDB-pull panes on upload page
- mc-mc dots in multicrit kin were actually all dots
- added reduceBuild() function to model.php
- implemented removeModel() and tested it from the command line scripts
- created a disk-too-full die() in mpInitEnvirons()
- added endsWith() to strings.php
- added system logging function. Individual user logging is of little use
  and will be effectively replaced by automated lab notebook entries.
- implemented a progress bar and list of tasks for analysis script
- did the same for addmodel and reduce-build jobs

### 3pre11 ###
- updated PDB stat to find nonpolar H in nucleic acids, too.
- updated pdbstat to find nucleic acid residues
- changed preparePDB() to not add H; now done by reduceNoBuild()
- renamed prepared() upload PDB so as not to confuse user
- reworked analysis scripts so that only selected jobs are performed
- reworked analysis so that hydrogens are added "just in time" if needed
- put both mc-mc and sc-(anything) dots in AAC kinemage, but separately
- removed Ramachandran JPEG and EPS files in anticipation of providing PDFs
- removed Mage as a necessary binary
- modified multicriterion kin to separate mc-mc and sc-x dots
- replaced findOutliers() with 4 separate functions
- analysis display page now adapts to the presence / absence of various criteria
- refactored jobs/addmodel.php into lib/model.php:addModel()
- refactored jobs/analyze.php into lib/analyze.php:runAnalysis()
- created a proof-of-concept cmd-line-driven script to use MP functions
- added machinery to create a ZIP archive of all a model's files

### 3pre10 ###
- really reworked page header/footer/styling. Style sheet hasn't been finished yet.
- removed all tab bar images and templates
- came up with a pretty decent "look" for the site; may change colors to match kinemage site
- rearranged upload page
- allowed user to revisit previously generated analysis
- each model now has its own download URL too
- implemented function to generate kinemage-viewing links
- added embedded KiNG page for kinemage viewing
- tried a pale brown background theme
- fixed accidentally introduced bug in analyze_display.php
- made nicer display of multi crit kinemage
- added Ramachandran plots to output of analysis (jpeg, kin, eps)
- added CB dev, all-atom contacts to analysis output

### 3pre9 ###
- added 'ignoreSegID' option to handle old Reduce'd files with 'new' in segID field
- loadRamachandran() and loadRotamer() now decompose residue names into parts
- loadCbetaDev() now synthesizes a residue name from the parts
- loadClashlist() now picks up worst clash per residue
- badRes now markes residues with clashes >= 0.40 A
- refactored badRes code into lib/analysis.php:findOutliers()
- started lib/visualize.php to make data visualizations
- wrote functions to find res with alt confs and guess at res center in 3-space
- started working on the new MultiCrit

### 3pre8 ###
- brought the whole project under Subversion version control
- created a shell script to restore filesystem state (symlinks and permissions)
- created analyze_display.php for Jeremy to start working in
- fixed loadCbetaDev() to deal with multiple headers from Prekin
- created a basic file-listing page
- administrator can now "enter" sessions from the monitoring page
- mocked up some HTML layouts for pages
- check script now tells about how big file uploads can be
- added "last touched" to admin page
- moved all string and formating functions to strings.php
- set svn:ignore properties on public_html/ and on symlinks in bin/
- check for presence of models before trying to list them.
  Alternately, we could just define $_SESSION['models'] = array() at startup.
  Actually, lets do that too.

### 3pre7 ###
- filled in the PDB upload form, though it doesn't do anything yet.
- implemented first cases of "More/Fewer options" links
- implemented background execution via launchBackground()
- implemented background job monitoring via job_progress.php
- file upload now works, basically, though no processing is performed.
- added config parameter MP_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE
- worked out a bug in launchBackground(): session data wasn't written immediately
- addmodel.php now does some nice pre-processing of all new models uploaded
- pdbstat now reports refinement program and temp, and a count of CNS headers
- refactored jobs/addmodel.php to facilitate future offline scripts
- created a function to write session data to disk immediately
- reworked the definition of a model entry.
  Now using -build will create a new model, so you can compare to the old.
- did proof-of-concept for Cbeta deviation analysis and clashlist

### 3pre6 ###
- filled in the Finish tab (rough draft) to allow users to log out
- described what should go in each tab

### 3pre5 ###
- fixed bug in GC function
- made PATH in config.php depend on MP_BASE_DIR
- added some things to check_config.php
- PATH setup is smarter: auto-detects OS and adds our bin/ directory
- added read-only marker for sessions to enable D&J's partial results
- it might make sense to make labbook keywords an array, but then
  transmitting them in a form becomes harder.
- started working on a standard page header
- Experimented with tables, images to make tabs. Images are a better bet.
- made first drafts of all the tab pages (empty). Linked them together.
- made labbook page work pretty well

### 3pre4 ###
- refined sessions yet again: now each top level page must know where
  the base installation directory is, relative to itself.
- session support has been reworked to use MP_BASE_DIR
- session create now defaults to false. This limits points of entry.
- added marker file for session lifetime
- added administrator overview of current sessions
- created garbage collection functions

### 3pre3 ###
- added (optional) mode to mkdir() call in sessions.php
- added time zone support to lab notebook
- continued refining session code

### 3pre2 ###
- wrote the which() part of check_config.php
- configured sessions to never use cookies
- implemented bare-bones of a lab notebook system
- rearranged how the include() system is set up

### 3pre1 ###
- built custom session-handling functions
- established simple test case for running background jobs
- started documentation
