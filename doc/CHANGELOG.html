### 3pre8 ###
- brought the whole project under Subversion version control
- created a shell script to restore filesystem state (symlinks and permissions)

### 3pre7 ###
- filled in the PDB upload form, though it doesn't do anything yet.
- implemented first cases of "More/Fewer options" links
- implemented background execution via launchBackground()
- implemented background job monitoring via job_progress.php
- file upload now works, basically, though no processing is performed.
- added config parameter MP_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE
- worked out a bug in launchBackground(): session data wasn't written immediately
- addmodel.php now does some nice pre-processing of all new models uploaded
- pdbstat now reports refinement program and temp, and a count of CNS headers
- refactored jobs/addmodel.php to facilitate future offline scripts
- created a function to write session data to disk immediately
- reworked the definition of a model entry.
  Now using -build will create a new model, so you can compare to the old.
- did proof-of-concept for Cbeta deviation analysis and clashlist

### 3pre6 ###
- filled in the Finish tab (rough draft) to allow users to log out
- described what should go in each tab

### 3pre5 ###
- fixed bug in GC function
- made PATH in config.php depend on MP_BASE_DIR
- added some things to check_config.php
- PATH setup is smarter: auto-detects OS and adds our bin/ directory
- added read-only marker for sessions to enable D&J's partial results
- it might make sense to make labbook keywords an array, but then
  transmitting them in a form becomes harder.
- started working on a standard page header
- Experimented with tables, images to make tabs. Images are a better bet.
- made first drafts of all the tab pages (empty). Linked them together.
- made labbook page work pretty well

### 3pre4 ###
- refined sessions yet again: now each top level page must know where
  the base installation directory is, relative to itself.
- session support has been reworked to use MP_BASE_DIR
- session create now defaults to false. This limits points of entry.
- added marker file for session lifetime
- added administrator overview of current sessions
- created garbage collection functions

### 3pre3 ###
- added (optional) mode to mkdir() call in sessions.php
- added time zone support to lab notebook
- continued refining session code

### 3pre2 ###
- wrote the which() part of check_config.php
- configured sessions to never use cookies
- implemented bare-bones of a lab notebook system
- rearranged how the include() system is set up

### 3pre1 ###
- built custom session-handling functions
- established simple test case for running background jobs
- started documentation
